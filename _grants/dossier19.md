DoSSIER is an EU Horizon 2020 ITN/ETN on Domain Specific Systems for Information Extraction and Retrieval. DoSSIER will elucidate, model, and address the different information needs of professional users. It mobilizes an excellent and highly synergistic team of world-leading Information Retrieval (IR) experts from 5 EU States who, together with 3 academic partners (universities in the US, Japan, and Australia), and 11 industrial partners (dynamic SMEs and large corporations) will produce fundamental insights into how users comprehend, formulate, and access information in professional environments.

DoSSIER research is structured in three areas:

- Models: fundamental models of users and domain specificity,
- Methods: contextual and personalized search, and
- Applications: workflow, task and the interface.

Each area individually and in cross-field fertilisation, will produce breakthroughs in our understanding of computer-supported human information search workflows. The result will be a new generation of information access systems, which will accelerate innovation cycles in EU academia and industry. To be both concrete and generic, DoSSIER consists of 8 projects identifying a target domain and 7 projects acting horizontally across domains. Three domains are used: science & technology innovation, law, and health. Questions currently unanswerable (e.g. What is the key innovation difference between these two patents?) will be answerable either directly by a system, or by the development of cognition-enhancing instruments for interacting with information.
