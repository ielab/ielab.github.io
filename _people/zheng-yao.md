I am Zheng, currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at the School of Computer Science, The University of Queensland (July 2022 – present). My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Passage Retrieval**, with a particular emphasis on:  

* **LLM Evaluation & Benchmark Development**
  
* **Information Retrieval & Machine Learning**  

**Academic Contributions**  
I am committed to advancing the field through rigorous empirical research. My contributions include:  
1. **Yao, Z. (2024).** Proposed a multi-model approach for depression detection in Chinese social media (accepted at the *5th International Seminar on AI, Networking and IT*).  
2. **Liu et al. (2024).** Developed *FineMath*, a fine-grained mathematical evaluation benchmark for Chinese LLMs ([arXiv:2403.07747](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07747.pdf)).  
3. **Liu et al. (2025).** Designed *CCDE*, a Chinese clinical diagnostic evaluation benchmark for LLMs (submitted to *COLING 2025*).  
4. Recent work on **“Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning: A Reproducibility Study”** has been accepted for oral presentation at the *SIGIR 2025 Resource & Reproducibility Papers Track*.  

**Professional Experience**  
- **Research Assistant** (Aug. 2023 – Oct. 2024, TJUNLP Lab, Tianjin University): Spearheaded data engineering and model optimization for AI in healthcare and metaphor identification.  
- **Academic Intern** (2024 – Present, Artificial Intelligence for the Queensland Digital Health Center (QDHeC))
