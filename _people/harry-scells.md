My research investigates how to improve medical systematic review creation with Information Retrieval. My research focuses on developing methods to assist information specialists in creating more effective queries in shorter periods of time. To do this, I am investigating automatic methods of query formulation, refinement, visualisation, and understandability.

For an overview of my research during my PhD, please visit the [systematic reviews project page](/projects/systematic-reviews). Below is a list of publications I have authored. Please see the link to my Google scholar page above for a more comprehensive list.
