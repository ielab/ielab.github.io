description: PhD student, UQ, Searching through Conversations.  
---
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Queensland â€“ Australia, School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). My focus is on Information Retrieval and mainly on how people search through chat apps. In this context, I aim to better understand how people search for their information needs within the history of conversations. Consequently, I study the possibility of designing a search engine for chat conversations.
