description: I’m Shuai Wang, a PhD student working at UQ,  I’m supervised by Professor. Guido Zuccon and A.Professor. Bevan Koopman. I received my Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Western Australia in 2019, then leveled up with a Master of Engineering Science degree from the University of Queensland in 2021. Now, I’m a PhD student at UQ, exploring the wilds of information retrieval, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. Specifically, I'm working on automation for medical systematic reviews, where I have been currently focused on the development of Automatic Mesh Term Suggestion, Screening Prioritisation, Seed-drievn methods and Boolean query formulation. I also work as a tutor at UQ, teaching courses like INFS7410 (information retrieval and web search).
