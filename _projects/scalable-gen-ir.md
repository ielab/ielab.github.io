## About this project

The **Scalable Generative Information Retrieval (IR)** project investigates how generative models can be applied to information retrieval tasks in a scalable and efficient manner. Our goal is to develop retrieval systems that leverage large language models (LLMs) while remaining practical for real-world applications, such as domain-specific search and systematic reviews.

### Key Areas of Focus
- **Elastic & Scalable Modeling:** Our models support dynamic adjustment of transformer depth and embedding dimensionality, enabling flexible trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. We also leverage techniques like **2D Matryoshka pruning** to train adaptable models that operate efficiently across a range of deployment budgets.
- **Context Compression for RAG:** We explore advanced context compression techniques, such as **COCOM (Context Compression Model)**, to enhance the efficiency of RAG systems.
